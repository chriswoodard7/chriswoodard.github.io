        <h2>Smart Surgical Tool for Tissue Perfusion (Briteseed)</h2>
        <p>Programmed real-time photoplethysmography signal analysis in a surgical grasper. Replaced MATLAB interface with Python GUI to improve responsiveness and control. Processed hyperspectral tissue data for ML-based tissue differentiation.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="project">
        <h2>NAFS Detector â€“ Noninvasive Animal Monitoring</h2>
        <p>Developed a smart sensor system to detect depressive states in rats using lateral motion data. Designed a custom optical flow and IR sensor connected via SPI. Modeled enclosure for robustness in lab environments.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="project">
        <h2>Automation Work at Moderna Therapeutics</h2>
        <p>Built C# deck-loading UI for HAMILTON STAR platforms. Integrated Smartsheet API for real-time issue tracking. Automated high-throughput liquid handling workflows. Developed a PLC-HMI-controlled manifold for LNP synthesis, cutting system size by 70%.</p>
